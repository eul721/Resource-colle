This is a Google Sheets add-on that provides the utility to easily fill in resource expenditure from your Kancolle sortie runs. 

This is aimed for users who have the habit to log resource usage for monthly EO maps, event maps, and farming hunts.

It is essentially kREL's google sheets version.

**Users of this script will need to copy-paste the source files into the sheets' script editor. Google Apps Script does not allow add-on creation from external sources**
